# Movie-Recommender-System

Develop a Collaborative Filtering system to predict as accurately as possible the user item ratings.
Collaborative Filtering (CF) systems measure similarity of users by their item preferences and/or measure similarity of items by the users who like them. For this CF systems extract Item profiles and user profiles and then compute similarity of rows and columns in the Utility Matrix. (In this assignment you are given a number of ratings, from which it is possible to build a utility matrix.) In addition to using various similarity measures for finding the most similar items or users, one can use latent factor models (matrix decomposition) and other hybrid approaches to improve on the training and test data RMSE scores. We encourage you use functions available in spark libraries for similarity computation, SVD decomposition etc. However, you cannot use the spark ALS package! Performing these tasks in parallel on multiple cores is required as the dataset is quite large.
